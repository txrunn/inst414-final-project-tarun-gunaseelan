# Diabetes Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains the source code for a data science pipeline that
predicts the progression of diabetes based on the UCI diabetes dataset. The
project was developed as part of an academic course and demonstrates how to
build and test a simple extract–transform–load (ETL) pipeline, train a
machine‑learning model, evaluate it, and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore factors associated with diabetes
progression and to build a model that distinguishes between individuals with
higher and lower disease progression. The pipeline uses the diabetes dataset
available from `scikit‑learn`, which originates from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository. This dataset contains 442 observations of 10 baseline variables
(such as age, body mass index and various serum measurements) along with a
numerical target representing a quantitative measure of disease progression one
year after baseline.

In the transformation step the numerical target is converted into a binary
classification variable indicating whether the target value is above the
median. A logistic regression model is then trained to predict this class.
The pipeline reports evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall and
ROC AUC) and produces several plots, including a confusion matrix, ROC
curve and feature‑importance chart.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/txrunn/inst414-final-project-tarun-gunaseelan.git
   cd inst414-final-project-tarun-gunaseelan
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

Execute the entire pipeline from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will:

1. Extract the diabetes dataset and save a raw CSV in `data/extracted/`.
2. Transform the raw data, generate exploratory statistics and save a processed CSV in `data/processed/`.
3. Train a logistic regression model on the processed data.
4. Evaluate the model and save a CSV of metrics plus plots (confusion matrix and ROC curve) in `data/outputs/`.
5. Generate an additional feature‑importance plot.

The script writes a `pipeline.log` file containing minimal logging messages that can help you trace the execution of each stage.

## Data

The project uses the diabetes dataset included in `scikit‑learn`. A data
dictionary (`data_dictionary_diabetes.csv`) is included in
`data/reference-tables/` to describe each variable in the dataset. No
external APIs or additional datasets are required.
