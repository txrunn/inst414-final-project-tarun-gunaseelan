Entry point for the diabetes prediction pipeline.

This script orchestrates the extract, transform, load (ETL) stages,
trains a machineâ€‘learning model, evaluates it, and generates visualizations.
Logging is configured to write minimal messages to a file and to the console.

Run this file from the root of the project to execute the entire workflow.
